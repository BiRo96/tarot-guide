# The Tarot Guide

This project is meant to be an encyclopedia for tarot decks, cards and the meanings behind them.

Since I am interested in these cards for years, at least for the art behind it, I finally managed to take some time to study them.

I would like to make an offline encyclopedia for myself, and the others interested in this "knowledge".

My main puprose is to gather all the important and interesting information about the Tarot.

Things I want to reach with this project
- gather multiple decks...  
 (Rider-Waite, Crowley Toth, etc)
    - gather multiple sub-decks  
    (original art-works, fan made art-works)
    - we could compare each deck art style and meaning.
- making offline an data-set for the meanings behind the cards, depending on what deck you use (at first, only the main decks will be my goal).
- guidance for spread types
- most of all: all of these goals mentioned above with multilingual support

## Note
First of all: I'm not an expert.
- I accept help in this project, if you have ideas, or time to make a new feature.
- I can't help you understand the Tarot cards, since I'm still learning it too. I read books about it, and I try to make an open-source "digitalized guide book" for myself and you who are interested in it.
- I hope you will like my effort, and not stealing this project, since it's not protected at all with any license.
- As I plan, it will always be free, will never contain unwanted or disturbing ads, but I'll try to make an option if you want to give me a tip, or buy me a coffee as an honor for this project...  
**BUT ONLY** if I will reach a level in its developement, where I can say I feel rightful to accept some kindness of yours...
